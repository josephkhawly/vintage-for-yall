        My Mom&rsquo;s &lsquo;80s NYC Style Inspired My Favorite Winter Staples
      </h1>
      <h2 className='font-bold text-xl mb-[30px]'>
        Despite my teen years blogging on Tumblr, Iâ€™ll never be as cool
      </h2>
      <p className='mb-5'>
        Buying vintage and secondhand via Etsy or at your local Goodwill often signifies an
        eco-conscious clothing fan or affiliation with the notorious title of &ldquo;Depop
        Girlie.&rdquo; &nbsp;However, in my mother&rsquo;s teen years, vintage clothes were worn to
        express your identity as a part of a subculture.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-5'>
        New subcultures today are rare, with their roots stemming from niche and often outcast
        communities that didn&rsquo;t prescribe to the social norm either as a political statement
        or to simply find other people who equally bodied their interests. From punk to steampunk,
        subculture has always existed alongside vintage, secondhand, and DIY clothing.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-5'>
        My mother, then Marialena Morelli, grew up in the Bronx&rsquo;s Pelham Bay and spent her
        free time thrifting and clubbing in the city, making her way to cultural landmarks of
        &lsquo;80s NY like Area and The Peppermint Lounge, where she attended one of the live
        recordings of Smell of Female by The Cramps.{' '}
      </p>
      <p className='mb-5'>
        I asked Marialena how she would have defined herself back then. &ldquo;Categorically, I was
        a new wave kid, but I had some good punk looks, too. We&rsquo;d get the Village Voice to see
        which bands were playing and then check the ads section for any sales on vintage
        clothes&rdquo; she laughs. Despite my teen years giving me a brief moment of fame via
        Tumblr, I&rsquo;ll never be as cool.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-5'>
        Her favorite stores? Canal Street Jeans and The Unique Boutique in The Village: a
        half-vintage, half-modern one-stop shop for the best clubwear.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-5'>
        Marialena reminisces on her favorite &lsquo;80s pieces you should add to your closet this
        winter while I share the secondhand shopping tips to help you find them.

        MID-CENTURY BLACK WOOL OVERCOAT
      </h2>
      <p className='mb-5'>
        Marialena acknowledges that this style coat was an attempt to get the London look, as punks
        and new wavers across the pond utilized vintage menswear from the &lsquo;40s and &lsquo;50s
        to get their point across. However, all-black outfits remain distinctly New York, yet that
        monochromatic elegance can definitely travel.{' '}
      </p>
      <p className='mb-5'>
        Sporting an understated black coat&nbsp;to turn an okay outfit into a conversation starter.
        When searching eBay for mid-century coats, make sure you&rsquo;re looking into
        &ldquo;overcoats,&rdquo; &ldquo;herringbone,&rdquo; and &ldquo;single-breasted.&rdquo;
        However, if you want a silhouette that&rsquo;s distinctly &lsquo;80s with heavy shoulder
        pads, use searches that include designers like Calvin Klein or features like double-breasted
        and notched collars.

      <h2 className='font-bold text-3xl mt-5 mb-[15px] uppercase'>TAPERED SUIT PANTS</h2>
      <p className='mb-5'>
        The best day-to-night item? Marialena says it&rsquo;s the high-waisted, tapered pant. What
        makes these trousers great is their ability to give you a waist while still accomplishing
        that effortless, baggy look.
      </p>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        Mom suggests getting solid black or a color your closet is used to (she stuck with a deep,
        plum purple). In addition to narrowing it down by color, I recommend playing around with
        &ldquo;high waisted&rdquo; and &ldquo;pleated&rdquo; in your search. You&rsquo;ll want to
        get these a little cropped or cuff them, so you can show off some colorful socks and a
        ballet flat.

        CARDIGAN WITH APPLIQUE OR BEADED DETAIL
      </h2>
      <p className='mb-5'>
        Being big on borrowing from the family, Mom also loved sporting Nana&rsquo;s 1950s cardigan
        that had the sweetest applique floral detail, but many styles from the time also featured
        intricate beading. To better narrow things down, you can include terms like
        &ldquo;rockabilly&rdquo; or swap &ldquo;50s&rdquo; for &ldquo;60s,&rdquo; as not every piece
        will be from this decade (nor will every seller be great at dating their items). This soft
        addition provides a fun contrast to a perfectly worn-in band tee and some combat boots but
        can still read casual elegance if paired with tapered pants.{' '}

      <h2 className='font-bold text-3xl mt-5 mb-[15px] uppercase'>NEON SWEATER DRESSES</h2>
      <p className='mb-5'>
        Marialena loves those electric hues and hates that they&rsquo;ve turned into a clich&eacute;
        often seen at Party City. After all, there is a right and a wrong way to wear neon. She
        suggests finding a neon piece that&rsquo;s monochromatic or utilizes a chunkier knit and
        paired with black accessories and silver hardware.{' '}
      </p>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        &lsquo;80s sweaters, especially solids, can take a minute to locate online, but less is more
        with your search. Stick as close to &ldquo;80s neon sweater dress&rdquo; as you can. Also,
        don&rsquo;t dip into &lsquo;70s knits, as you&rsquo;ll see more of an A-line skirt versus
        that straight, baggier style that looks closer to an elongated sweater versus an actual
        dress. You can take this look out to dinner by opting for knee-high boots or take it to run
        errands with sneakers and a lacey sock.
