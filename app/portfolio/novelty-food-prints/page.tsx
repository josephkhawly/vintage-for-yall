        It might feel as if tomatoes in fashion quite literally came out of nowhere&mdash;

        &mdash;but food prints have quite a rich history when it comes to trending style. Also known
        as &ldquo;conversation prints,&rdquo; novelty patterns were originally seen in
        children&rsquo;s clothing depicting nursery rhymes and other educational imagery to wearers
        still learning to speak. Eventually making their way into popular women&rsquo;s fashions of
        the &lsquo;40s and &lsquo;50s, designs were created to quite literally, give people
        something to talk about, whether it be Greek mythology, gardening, or Campbell&rsquo;s Soup.
        So if anyone bothers arguing with you about it, your pasta dress is actually quite timeless.
