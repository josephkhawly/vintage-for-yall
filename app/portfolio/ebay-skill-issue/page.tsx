        Can&rsquo;t Find Cheap Designer Items on eBay? It Might Be A Skill Issue
      </h1>
      <h2 className='font-bold text-xl mb-[30px]'>
        Here&rsquo;s what those TikTok haul videos aren&rsquo;t telling you.
      </h2>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        I am a part of a generation that does not know life without eBay. eBay is the founding
        father of this entire mess and the reason vintage was able to segue out of its
        cult-following status. But lately on TikTok, creators have been sharing their insane
        designer finds on the site for jealousy-inducing prices.
      </p>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        If you&rsquo;re just becoming familiar with eBay or struggling to find/win your holy grail,
        it might just be a skill issue rather than a lack of supply. Here&rsquo;s some tricks you
        can implement to increase your search results and bid like a pro.
      </p>

      <h2 className='font-bold text-3xl mt-5 mb-[15px] uppercase'>SEARCH TERMS</h2>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        If you&rsquo;re struggling to even find your dream designer items in the first place, your
        search terms may need some work.
      </p>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        If you&rsquo;re looking for a specific item or brand, play around with formal and colloquial
        terms. For example, Betsey Johnson&rsquo;s &lsquo;80s pieces are also given the title
        &ldquo;punk label,&rdquo; referencing the tag used during this decade that featured a punk
        woman&rsquo;s head. Try swapping official product names for more generic descriptor terms
        relating to features like silhouette and fabric/material.{' '}
      </p>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        Another thing to note: eBay sellers are human. Humans make mistakes. For example, if
        you&rsquo;re trying to find a pair of shoes from the &lsquo;90s, try searching adjacent
        decades like the &lsquo;80s and Y2K. Even making mistakes in your search can be useful.
        Swapping terms for common misspellings, alternate ways to spell (think gray vs. grey), and
        regional language (like how the British say &ldquo;jumper&rdquo; instead of
        &ldquo;sweatshirt&rdquo;) can produce new results.{' '}
      </p>

      <h2 className='font-bold text-3xl mt-5 mb-[15px] uppercase'>BIDDING</h2>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        When it comes to &ldquo;Auction&rdquo; items, there are two important things to do when it
        comes to winning them. First, always keep your eBay notifications on. Second, set your own
        alarms. I will see my eBay notifications when a listing is ending &ldquo;soon,&rdquo; but
        will get distracted and end up missing out. If you&rsquo;re serious about securing an item,
        I suggest opting for timers at least five minutes and two minutes before a listing ends.
      </p>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        The final minute of an auction is the most crucial moment. My bidding strategy (that I would
        argue is the one thing I&rsquo;ve ever tried to gatekeep) involves playing a semi-dangerous
        waiting game through last-minute bidding. Bidding on an item too early, especially days in
        advance, can attract attention to the listing and alert those who already bid to
        competition.
      </p>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        If you&rsquo;re a little nervous, start bidding three to five minutes before the auction
        ends, but I&rsquo;d highly recommend waiting until the one to two-minute mark. Continue to
        monitor your highest bid and update accordingly, but by doing things last minute, it&rsquo;s
        possible your competition will have gotten distracted themselves or won&rsquo;t have enough
        time to make their next move.
      </p>

      <h2 className='font-bold text-3xl mt-5 mb-[15px] uppercase'>WATCHLIST</h2>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        Using the watchlist to save money is a great strategy for &ldquo;Buy It Now&rdquo; items but
        not ideal for &ldquo;Auction.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        Let&rsquo;s say you found the Miu Miu shoes of your dreams, but they&rsquo;re still a little
        out of budget. There is hope. Adding those items to your watchlist on eBay is not just a way
        to keep track of what you like, but a way for sellers to send you discounts. Even if the
        seller hasn&rsquo;t given you the option to make an offer on the listing, they can privately
        send offers this way. However, depending on their setup, these offers may or may not allow
        you to counter.{' '}
      </p>

      <h2 className='font-bold text-3xl mt-5 mb-[15px] uppercase'>MAKING OFFERS</h2>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        Good bidding etiquette is as important as having table manners. eBay does not allow you to
        make infinite offers like Poshmark, so make sure you&rsquo;re respectful of the seller and
        their boundaries. Not to say all sellers price their items fairly, but metaphorically,
        they&rsquo;re the dinner party host, and you&rsquo;re their guest.{' '}
      </p>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        As someone who&rsquo;s sold vintage clothing for the past seven years, I hate when people
        lowball me or start with a lowball offer to open up a conversation about what I&rsquo;m
        willing to accept. I never advise against shooting your shot but try to be realistic and
        begin with an offer that incorporates the lowest you think the seller would go. If someone
        wants $100 via Buy It Now, they might not entertain an offer of $50. If they don&rsquo;t,
        know that coming back with $55 is not a good look. Directly communicate in the offer notes
        or send a message if you want to show you have good intentions. If you don&rsquo;t, accept
        defeat or significantly up the amount.
      </p>

      <p className='mb-5'>
        Keep in mind eBay sellers can also set offer minimums that are not visible until you go
        below this limit. Not meeting a seller&rsquo;s minimum still counts towards your offer
        total, so if you catch this notification, make sure you evaluate the difference between that
        declined offer and the Buy It Now price before you make your next move.
